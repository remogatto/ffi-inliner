ffi-inliner
  by Andrea Fazzi
  http://github.com/remogatto/ffi-inliner

== DESCRIPTION:

With ffi-inliner you can run C code within your ruby script.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Mix C snippets in your Ruby code and gulp it on the fly!
* It's based on Ruby-FFI so the C code you inject is portable across
  Ruby implementations!
* Yep, it means that you can run it on JRuby too!
* Fast compilation through tcc[http://bellard.org/tcc/]
* But it can use the system's compiler (e.g. gcc) on those platforms
  that don't support tcc (e.g. OSX) or that don't have it installed

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'ffi/inliner'

  module MyLib
    extend FFI::Inliner
    inline 'void say_hello(char* name) { printf("Hello, %s\n", name); }'
  end

  MyLib.say_hello('boys')

  class Foo
    include MyLib
  end

  Foo.new.say_hello('foos')
